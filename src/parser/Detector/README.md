# Detector

Stage 2: Shape Detector - Recognizes geometric shapes and nesting relationships.

## Modules

- **ShapeDetector.res** - Main detector module
- **BoxTracer.res** - Box boundary tracing algorithm
- **DividerDetector.res** - Divider line detection
- **HierarchyBuilder.res** - Nesting hierarchy construction

## Purpose

Identifies boxes, dividers, and their spatial relationships (containment, overlap)
from the 2D grid structure.
